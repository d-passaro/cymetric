# cymetric

cymetric is a Python package for learning of moduli-dependent Calabi-Yau metrics
using neural networks implemented in TensorFlow. 

## Features

The current version is an alpha-release so not all features mentioned below
are on the main branch yet. Features with an (*) will be released soonish.

* Point Generators for Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds and hypersurfaces
 from the Kreuzer-Skarke list (requires SageMath and Mathematica).
* A collection of custom TensorFlow models with different metric Ans√§tze.
* A matehmatica API for the point generators and TensorFlow models.
* Custom models for the bundle metric(*).
* Documentation exists(*).

## Installation

Create a new environment with

```console
conda create -n cymetric python=3.9
```

Then install with pip directly from github 

```console
conda activate cymetric
pip install git+https://github.com/pythoncymetric/cymetric.git
```


## Tutorials

There are some tutorials

1. In [1.PointGenerator.ipynb](notebooks/1.PointGenerator.ipynb) we explore the three
 different PointGenerators for codimension-1 CICY, general CICYs and CY in toric varieties
 on the Fermat Quintic. 
2. In [2.TensorFlow_models.ipynb](notebooks/2.TensorFlow_models.ipynb) we explore some of the
 TF custom models with the data generated in the first notebook. 
3. (*) There exists a [Mathematica integration](/notebooks/CYMetrics.nb), which allows to call the PointGenerators and the TensorFlow models. Furthermore, there are arbitrary
precision PointGenerators based on the wolfram language.
